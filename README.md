# TalkingEliza
A Talking Eliza AI mobile project

This project aims to create an AI which works in both offline as well as online mode.
As of now its not not connected to any AI engine, but using Eliza to do the conversation.
We need to integrate to an online converstaional AI and thus make it smarted.
An ideal implementation will be to create a new project on conversational AI and connect it, this way it will be a good playground for the opensource programmers worldwide.

I encourage all to send me pull requests and start working on this project as your learning/enhancing activity .
